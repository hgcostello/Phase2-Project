# Seller Assistance in King County

## Business Problem 
### In this project we decided to take a look at ways that we could optimize the way in which current homeowners in King County, Washington are able to determine the estimated market value of their house. We pulled data from the KC House Data file as well as from the Housing Price Index. Using both of these data sources we were able to create a model for predicting the estimated price for a house in Kings County. This would be beneficial for King County residents who are considering selling their houses to be able to get a good sense of how much their house would be worth. 

## Housing Price Index (HPI) 
### One of the factors that we considered when looking at price was the Housing Price Index. This is a "broad meansure of the movement of single-family property prices in the United States" (Investopedia). This metric is provided by the Federal Housing Finance Agency (FHFA) and can be mapped to individual housing units.
